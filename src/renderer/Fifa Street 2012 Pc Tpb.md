The game also features a new dribbling system that allows players to change direction quickly and evade defenders.
 
The game offers various types of matches, such as 5-a-side, 6-a-side, Futsal, Panna Rules, Last Man Standing, and Custom Matches. Each match has different rules and settings that affect the gameplay and strategy. For example, in Panna Rules, players can score extra points by performing panna tricks on their opponents; in Last Man Standing, players lose one teammate every time they score a goal until only one player remains. The game also features different venues around the world, such as London, Rio de Janeiro, Amsterdam, Tokyo, and New York. Each venue has its own atmosphere, music, and style of play.
