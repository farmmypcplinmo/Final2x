Assassin's Creed Revelations is the fourth installment in the popular stealth-action series, and it features a revamped and expanded multiplayer mode that offers more variety, customization and challenge than ever before. Whether you are new to the game or a veteran assassin, here are some tips and tricks to help you dominate the online matches on PC.
 
- **Choose your character wisely.** Each character has different abilities, weapons and perks that suit different playstyles and modes. For example, the Sentinel is good at blending in with crowds and using his hidden gun, while the Vanguard is more aggressive and can use her throwing knives to stun or kill enemies from a distance. Experiment with different characters and find the one that matches your preferences.
- **Use your abilities strategically.** Abilities are special skills that can give you an edge in combat or stealth, but they have cooldowns and limitations. For example, the Smoke Bomb can create a cloud of smoke that can hide you from pursuers or stun them if they enter it, but it can also alert nearby enemies of your presence. The Disguise can change your appearance to look like another character, but it can be detected by keen-eyed opponents. Use your abilities wisely and don't waste them.
- **Know your maps.** The multiplayer mode features several maps based on locations from the single-player campaign, such as Constantinople, Jerusalem and Rome. Each map has its own layout, landmarks and hiding spots that you can use to your advantage. Learn the maps by playing them often and memorizing the routes, shortcuts and vantage points. You can also use the Eagle Vision ability to highlight your target or pursuer on the map.
- **Play the objectives.** The multiplayer mode offers several modes that require different strategies and goals. For example, in Wanted mode, you have to hunt down a specific target while avoiding being killed by other players. In Manhunt mode, you have to work as a team to either assassinate or defend a group of targets. In Artifact Assault mode, you have to steal an artifact from the enemy base and bring it back to yours. Whatever mode you play, focus on the objectives and don't get distracted by kills or points.
- **Have fun.** The multiplayer mode of Assassin's Creed Revelations is meant to be a fun and immersive experience that lets you live out your fantasy of being an assassin in a historical setting. Don't take it too seriously or get frustrated by losses or mistakes. Enjoy the game and learn from your experiences. You can also watch videos of other players online to get some inspiration and tips for improving your skills.

Assassin's Creed Revelations is a great game that offers a thrilling and addictive multiplayer mode that will keep you hooked for hours. Follow these tips and tricks and you will soon become a master assassin on PC.
