Baritone is a popular mod for Minecraft that automates various tasks such as mining, building, farming and exploring. However, some users have reported that Baritone v1.2.8 does not mine redstone ore properly in Minecraft 1.12.2. This article will explain why this issue occurs and how to fix it.
 
## Why does Baritone v1.2.8 not mine redstone ore?
 
The reason why Baritone v1.2.8 does not mine redstone ore is because redstone ore has two different block IDs: `redstone_ore` and `lit_redstone_ore`. When Baritone taps redstone ore with a pickaxe, it changes to lit redstone ore and Baritone no longer sees it as a block to mine[^1^]. This is a bug that has been fixed in later versions of Baritone.

## How to fix Baritone v1.2.8 redstone mining issue?
 
There are two possible ways to fix Baritone v1.2.8 redstone mining issue:
 
1. Update Baritone to a newer version that has fixed this bug. The latest version of Baritone as of April 2023 is v1.8.3, which supports Minecraft 1.18.2[^2^]. You can download it from the official GitHub page of Baritone and follow the installation instructions there.
2. Add `lit_redstone_ore` to your ore mining list in Baritone v1.2.8. This is a quick and easy workaround that will make Baritone recognize both types of redstone ore as blocks to mine. To do this, you need to type `#mine lit_redstone_ore` in the chat after typing `#mine redstone_ore`. Alternatively, you can edit the `mineGoalIgnoreBlocks` setting in the `baritone_settings.txt` file and add `lit_redstone_ore` there.

## What are the features of Baritone mod?
 
Baritone mod is not just a simple autominer, but a powerful and versatile tool that can perform many tasks and operations in Minecraft. Some of the features of Baritone mod are:

- Long distance pathing and splicing: Baritone calculates paths in segments, and precalculates the next segment when the current one is about to end, so that itâs moving towards the goal at all times[^1^].
- Chunk caching: Baritone simplifies chunks to a compacted internal 2-bit representation (AIR, SOLID, WATER, AVOID) and stores them in RAM for better very-long-distance pathing. There is also an option to save these cached chunks to disk[^1^].
- Block breaking and placing: Baritone considers breaking and placing blocks as part of its path. It also takes into account your current tool set and hot bar. For example, if you have a Eff V diamond pick, it may choose to mine through a stone barrier, while if you only had a wood pick it might be faster to climb over it[^1^].
- Falling: Baritone will fall up to 3 blocks onto solid ground (configurable, if you have Feather Falling and/or donât mind taking a little damage). If you have a water bucket on your hotbar, it will fall up to 23 blocks and place the bucket beneath it. It will fall an unlimited distance into existing still water[^1^].
- Vines and ladders: Baritone understands how to climb and descend vines and ladders. There is experimental support for more advanced maneuvers, like strafing to a different ladder / vine column in midair (off by default, setting named allowVines). Baritone can break its fall by grabbing ladders / vines midair, and understands when that is and isnât possible[^1^].
- Opening fence gates and doors: Baritone can open fence gates and doors as part of its path, if they are not locked or obstructed[^1^].
- Slabs and stairs: Baritone can walk on slabs and stairs without jumping, saving hunger and time[^1^].
- Falling blocks: Baritone understands the costs of breaking blocks with falling blocks on top, and includes all of their break costs. Additionally, since it avoids breaking any blocks touching a liquid, it wonât break the bottom of a gravel stack below a lava lake (anymore)[^1^].
- Worldedit-style operations: Baritone can perform complex operations such as filling, replacing, copying, pasting, schematics, etc. by manipulating your Minecraft client using an artificial pathfinding intelligence[^1^].
- Custom commands: Baritone has a rich set of commands that you can use to control its behavior and settings. You can type `#help` in the chat to see a list of all available commands[^3^].
