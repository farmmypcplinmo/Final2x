The plot centers on four men attending a bachelor party in Las Vegas. While there, they are enticed by two prostitutes to join them at a private party way off the Strip. Once there, they are horrified to find themselves the subjects of a perverse game of torture, where members of the Elite Hunting Club are hosting the most sadistic show in town[^4^].
 
The film was released direct-to-DVD on December 27, 2011. It received mostly negative reviews from critics and fans of the previous films, who criticized the lack of gore, suspense, originality, and atmosphere. Some also felt that the film was a cheap cash-in on the popularity of the franchise and that it did not live up to the expectations set by Roth's films[^7^].
 
However, some reviewers praised the film for its twist ending, its dark humor, its acting, and its attempt to do something different with the concept of the Elite Hunting Club[^6^]. The film also has a cult following among some horror fans who enjoy its low-budget style, its exploitation elements, and its exploitation of Las Vegas as a setting[^6^].
