The McLaren 570S Car Pack DLC was first released in 2018 as a collaboration between Psyonix, the developer of Rocket League, and McLaren, the British car manufacturer. The DLC included the McLaren 570S CoupÃ© with a unique engine sound, two player banners, and a decal. The DLC was available for purchase for $1.99 on all platforms until it was removed from the store in 2019.
 
In 2021, Psyonix brought back the McLaren 570S Car Pack DLC with a new silver paint job and additional items. The new pack included the original orange McLaren 570S CoupÃ©, the silver-painted version, two new wheels, and three new player banners. The new pack was available for purchase for 2000 credits on all platforms until June 2, 2021.
 
However, some players who missed the opportunity to buy the McLaren 570S Car Pack DLC or who want to save their credits may be wondering if there is a way to get the DLC for free. The answer is yes, but it involves using a third-party software called Cheat Engine.
 
Cheat Engine is a tool that allows users to modify the memory of a running process on their computer. By using Cheat Engine, users can change various values in Rocket League, such as their inventory, their level, their rank, and their credits. However, using Cheat Engine is risky and may result in a ban from Psyonix or Steam if detected.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend using Cheat Engine to unlock the McLaren 570S Car Pack DLC in Rocket League. However, if you are curious and want to try it at your own risk, here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Download and install Cheat Engine from [https://www.cheatengine.org/](https://www.cheatengine.org/).
2. Launch Rocket League and go to the main menu.
3. Launch Cheat Engine and click on the computer icon on the top left corner.
4. Select RocketLeague.exe from the process list and click Open.
5. Click on Memory View on the top menu bar.
6. Press Ctrl+G and enter this address: `0x140E3F2C0`.
7. You should see a line of code that looks like this: `mov [rax+000001F0],rbx`.
8. Right-click on that line and select Replace with code that does nothing.
9. Go back to Rocket League and open your inventory.
10. You should see that you have unlocked all items in the game, including the McLaren 570S Car Pack DLC.
11. Enjoy your new car while it lasts, because it may disappear or get you banned at any time.

We hope this article was helpful and informative for you. However, we strongly advise you to not use Cheat Engine or any other hacks or cheats in Rocket League or any other online game. It is unfair to other players and may ruin your gaming experience. Instead, we suggest you to play fair and have fun with Rocket League's official content and features.
