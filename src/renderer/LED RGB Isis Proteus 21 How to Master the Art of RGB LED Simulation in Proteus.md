# How to Simulate LED RGB with ISIS Proteus 21
  
LED RGB is a type of light-emitting diode that can change its color depending on the voltage applied to its terminals. It is composed of three LEDs (red, green and blue) in a single package, and each one can be controlled independently or in combination to create different colors.

In this article, we will show you how to simulate LED RGB with ISIS Proteus 21, a powerful software for designing and testing electronic circuits. ISIS Proteus 21 allows you to create and simulate various components, such as microcontrollers, sensors, displays, and more.
  
## Step 1: Create a New Project
  
To start simulating LED RGB with ISIS Proteus 21, you need to create a new project. To do this, follow these steps:
  
- Open ISIS Proteus 21 and click on File > New Project.
- Enter a name for your project and choose a location to save it.
- Select the device you want to use for your simulation. In this case, we will use an Arduino Uno board.
- Click on Next and then Finish to create your project.

## Step 2: Add LED RGB and Resistors
  
Now that you have created your project, you need to add the LED RGB and the resistors to your schematic. To do this, follow these steps:
 
how to use an RGB LED in the proteus,  simulation of RGB led in proteus,  proteus based simulation of RGB LED,  how to make a simulation of RGB led light in proteus,  RGB led in proteus,  how to glow an RGB led with proteus,  how to create multi colour with RGB LED light in proteus,  RGB LED with Arduino in proteus software,  how to use an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) LED with an Arduino in Proteus software,  The RGB LED consists of three different LEDâ€™s, from the name you can guess that these LEDâ€™s are red, green and blue,  An RGB LED has 4 pins, one for each colour (Red, Green, Blue) and a common cathode,  It has three different colour-emitting diodes that can be combined to create all sorts of colour,  Any colour is possible depending on how bright each diode is,  The cathode will be connected to the ground and the 3 anodes will be connected through 220 Ohms resistors to 3 digital pins on the Arduino Board that can provide PWM signal,  We will use PWM for simulating analog output which will provide different voltage levels to the LEDs so we can get the desired colours,  In order to get red light on the LED we will call the setColor () function and set value of 255 for the redValue argument and 0 for the two others,  Respectively we can get the two others basic colors, green and blue,  When one in all the parts has the strongest intensity, the color may be a massive close to this primary color (red, green or blue),  when 2 parts have an equivalent strongest intensity, then the color may be a hue of a secondary color (a shade of cyan, magenta or yellow),  If you are using the common anode RGB led, then connect the long lead to the 5V of Arduino,  If you have any other Arduino, then make sure that you are using the PWM pins of that Arduino,  The PWM pins have a ~ sign with them,  In this experiment, connect pin 2,5,6 of the arduino Display to each 220ohm resistor respectively and then to pin of RGB diode which are mention their colours like: 1-red+r1=arduino pin-6 2-green+r2=arduino pin-5 3-blue+r3=arduino pin-3 4-ground terminal GND connects to GND,  By programming, we can set one or several of pins as High level to light up the corresponding LED (s),  Arduino Sketch const int redPin = 6; //Initialize RED Color pin const int greenPin = 5;//Initialize GREEN Color pin const int bluePin = 3;//Initialize BLUE Color pin void setup () { pinMode (redPin, OUTPUT);//Define RED Color pin as output pinMode (greenPin, OUTPUT);//Define GREEN Color pin as output pinMode (bluePin, OUTPUT);//Define BLUE Color pin as output } // Fuction to handle multiple colors void primaryColors (int redValue, int greenValue, int blueValue) { digitalWrite (redPin, redValue); digitalWrite (greenPin, greenValue); digitalWrite (bluePin, blueValue); } void loop () { delay (1000); primaryColors (1, 0, 0); // Red delay (2000); primaryColors (0, 1, 0); // Green delay (2000); primaryColors (0, 0, 1); // Blue delay (2000); primaryColors (1, 1, 0); // Yellow delay (2000); primaryColors (1, 0, 1); // Magenta delay (2000); primaryColors (0, 1, 1); // Cyan delay (2000); primaryColors (1, 1, 1); // White delay (2000); },  Fully compatible with Hayes/Bell 103A, 2l2A and CCITT V.22,  LED status indicator,  xbee modules are used for wireless communication,  they work on radio frequency (rf) and are very helpful in those projects where wireless communication is required,  using xbee modules we ca communicate between nodes etc

- Click on the Library icon on the left panel and search for "LED RGB". Drag and drop the LED RGB component to your schematic.
- Click on the Library icon again and search for "RES". Drag and drop three resistors (220 ohms each) to your schematic.
- Connect one end of each resistor to one of the terminals of the LED RGB (R, G and B).
- Connect the other end of each resistor to one of the digital pins of the Arduino Uno board (D9, D10 and D11).
- Connect the common terminal of the LED RGB (C) to the ground (GND) of the Arduino Uno board.

## Step 3: Write and Upload the Code
  
The next step is to write and upload the code that will control the LED RGB. To do this, follow these steps:

- Click on the Source Code icon on the left panel and select Arduino IDE.
- A new window will open with the Arduino IDE. Write the following code:

```c // Define the pins for the LED RGB #define RED_PIN 9 #define GREEN_PIN 10 #define BLUE_PIN 11  // Define some colors #define RED 255,0,0 #define GREEN 0,255,0 #define BLUE 0,0,255 #define YELLOW 255,255,0 #define CYAN 0,255,255 #define MAGENTA 255,0,255 #define WHITE 255,255,255 #define BLACK 0,0,0  // Define an array of colors int colors[][3] = RED,GREEN,BLUE,YELLOW,CYAN,MAGENTA,WHITE,BLACK;  // Define a variable to store the current color index int colorIndex = 0;  void setup()    // Set the pins as outputs   pinMode(RED_PIN, OUTPUT);   pinMode(GREEN_PIN, OUTPUT);   pinMode(BLUE_PIN, OUTPUT);   void loop()    // Set the color of the LED RGB according to the current color index   analogWrite(RED_PIN, colors[colorIndex][0]);   analogWrite(GREEN_PIN, colors[colorIndex][1]);   analogWrite(BLUE_PIN, colors[colorIndex][2]);      // Increment the color index and wrap around if necessary   colorIndex++;   if (colorIndex >= sizeof(colors)/sizeof(colors[0]))      colorIndex = 0;         // Wait for one second before changing the color   delay(1000);  ```
- Click on Verify to compile your code and check for errors.
- Click on Upload to upload your code to your Arduino Uno board.

## Step 4: Run the Simulation
