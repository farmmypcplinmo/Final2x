The story follows Richard Cypher, a young woodsman who discovers his true destiny as the Seeker, a hero prophesied to defeat the evil tyrant Darken Rahl. Along with Kahlan Amnell, a mysterious confessor who can control people's wills with her touch, and Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander, a powerful wizard and Richard's grandfather, Richard embarks on a perilous journey to find the Book of Counted Shadows, a magical tome that holds the key to Rahl's downfall.
 
The first season of Legend of the Seeker introduces the main characters and the world of the Midlands, a land divided by a magical boundary from the Westlands, where Richard lives, and D'Hara, where Rahl rules. The season also features various enemies and allies that Richard and his friends encounter along the way, such as the Mord-Sith, a group of female warriors trained to torture and kill magic users; the Sisters of the Light, a benevolent order of sorceresses who teach Richard how to use his gift; and Cara Mason, a former Mord-Sith who joins Richard's quest after being freed from Rahl's influence.
 
The first season of Legend of the Seeker received mixed reviews from critics and fans. Some praised the show's action scenes, visual effects, scenery, and chemistry between the leads, while others criticized the show's deviation from the source material, lack of character development, and clichÃ©d plotlines. The show also faced low ratings and cancellation threats throughout its run. Despite these challenges, the show managed to develop a loyal fan base and was renewed for a second season.
