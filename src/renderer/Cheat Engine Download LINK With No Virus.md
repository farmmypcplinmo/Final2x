### How to Use Cheat Engine
 
Now that you have installed Cheat Engine, you may wonder how to use it. Cheat Engine is a powerful tool that can scan the memory of a game and find the values that correspond to various aspects of the game, such as health, ammo, money, etc. You can then change these values to alter the game behavior and create cheats. Here are some basic steps to use Cheat Engine:
 
1. Launch Cheat Engine and click on the "Select a process to open" button on the top left corner. A list of running processes will appear. Find the process that belongs to the game you want to hack and click on it. Then click on "Open".
2. Go back to the game and find a value that you want to change. For example, if you want to change your health, look at your health bar and note down the current value.
3. Switch back to Cheat Engine and click on the "First Scan" button. Enter the value you noted down in the "Value" box and make sure the "Value Type" is set to "4 Bytes". Then click on "First Scan". A list of addresses and values will appear on the left panel.
4. Go back to the game and do something that changes the value you want to hack. For example, if you want to change your health, get hit by an enemy or heal yourself.
5. Switch back to Cheat Engine and click on the "Next Scan" button. Enter the new value in the "Value" box and click on "Next Scan". The list of addresses and values will be reduced.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you have only one or a few addresses left in the list. These are the addresses that control the value you want to hack.
7. Select one or more addresses from the list and click on the red arrow button at the bottom. The addresses will be added to the bottom panel.
8. Double-click on the value column of any address in the bottom panel and enter a new value. For example, if you want to have unlimited health, enter a very large number. The value will be changed in the game immediately.
9. Congratulations! You have successfully hacked the game using Cheat Engine. You can save your cheats by clicking on the "File" menu and choosing "Save". You can also share your cheats with others by clicking on the "Table" menu and choosing "Generate Generic Trainer".
