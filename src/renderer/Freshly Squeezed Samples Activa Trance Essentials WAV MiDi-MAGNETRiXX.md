- First, unzip the sample pack and locate the folder that contains the WAV and MIDI files. You will see that the folder is organized into subfolders such as Drum Loops, Drum One Shots, FX One Shots, Construction Kits and MIDI Library.
- Next, open your DAW and create a new project. You can use any tempo and key that you like, but we recommend using 138 BPM and F# minor as a reference, since these are the settings used by Activa in most of his tracks.
- Then, browse through the Drum Loops folder and choose a loop that suits your style. You can preview the loops by clicking on them or dragging them into your DAW. You will notice that each loop has a BPM and a key information in its name, so you can easily match it with your project settings.
- After that, drag and drop the loop into your DAW and place it on an audio track. You can adjust the volume, pan, EQ and other parameters to make it sound better. You can also chop, slice, reverse or rearrange the loop to create variations.
- Next, browse through the Drum One Shots folder and choose some samples that you like. You will find kicks, snares, claps, hats, cymbals and more. You can use these samples to create your own drum patterns or to layer them with the drum loops for more impact.
- To use the drum one shots, you need to load them into a sampler or a drum machine plugin in your DAW. You can either use the built-in sampler or drum machine of your DAW or use a third-party plugin such as Battery, Kontakt or Geist. Then, assign each sample to a different pad or key on your MIDI controller or keyboard.
- After that, create a MIDI track and record your drum pattern using your MIDI controller or keyboard. You can also draw your drum pattern using your mouse or edit it using the piano roll or step sequencer in your DAW. Make sure to quantize your drum pattern to make it sound tight and groovy.
- Next, browse through the FX One Shots folder and choose some samples that you like. You will find risers, downlifters, impacts, sweeps and more. You can use these samples to create transitions and build-ups in your track.
- To use the FX one shots, simply drag and drop them into your DAW and place them on an audio track. You can adjust the volume, pan, EQ and other parameters to make them sound better. You can also chop, slice, reverse or rearrange them to create variations.
- Next, browse through the Construction Kits folder and choose a kit that you like. You will find five kits that contain all the elements of a full trance track such as basses, leads, pads, plucks and more. Each kit also has a MIDI file that contains the melody and harmony of the track.
- To use the construction kits, simply drag and drop the WAV files into your DAW and place them on separate audio tracks. You can adjust the volume, pan, EQ and other parameters to make them sound better. You can also chop, slice, reverse or rearrange them to create variations.
- If you want to change the melody or harmony of the track, you can use the MIDI file instead of the WAV file. Simply drag and drop the MIDI file into your DAW and place it on a MIDI track. Then, load a synthesizer plugin such as Sylenth1, Spire or Serum on another MIDI track and assign it to receive input from the MIDI file.
- After that, browse through the presets of your synthesizer plugin and choose a sound that you like. You can tweak the sound using the knobs and sliders of your plugin or use automation to create movement and variation.
- Finally, browse through the MIDI Library folder and choose some files that you like. You will find hundreds of MIDI files that contain melodies, bass lines, chords and more. You can use these files as a source of inspiration or as a starting point for your own tracks.
